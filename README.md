# ExtraCreditGameJam4_Summer2019
This is the repository for game I am creating for Extra Credits Game Jam #4.  The duration of the Jam is 100 hours and the topic is Connect.  The Jam ran from Thursday, May 30th, 2019 to Monday, June 3rd, 2019.

The extra credit challenges were:
1. **Extra Open**: Be a good person and open-source your game so others can learn from your work! Include the source files on your published game page (Credit: yusdacra)
2. **Extra Remix**: Include a feature/asset from a game or any other creative project you've worked on before, even if you didn't use it in the final version (Credit: wezu)
3. **"Extra"-Vert**: Make a game that can be played with other people, in-person (Credit: Mr. Jam)
4. **Extra Monochromatic**: Use only a 2 color palette (Credit: EnioLotero, SmallTestAccount)
